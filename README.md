# Group D Bioinformatics Assignment
## Introduction
Bioinformatics is the study and interpretation of biological data through the use of biology, computer science, and information technology. Its primary objectives include identifying genetic variances, predicting protein architectures, and assessing metabolic pathways. The field's history extends back to the 1960s, when DNA sequencing was first developed. Sequence alignment methods, protein structure prediction software, genome assembly programs, data mining, machine learning, and network analysis are some of the tools and approaches used. Databases like GenBank, UniProt, and the Protein Data Bank are critical. Bioinformatics is applied to genomes, proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, drug development, personalized medicine, and agricultural biotechnology.

#About Group

Group D comprises Human Anatomy students from Bauchi State University Gadau at the 400 level. They are exploring diverse branches of bioinformatics such as Proteomics, Computational Biology, Metabolomics, Transcriptomics, Functional Genomics, Phylogenetics, and Comparative Genomics. Despite their diverse backgrounds, they are collectively investigating the fundamental aspects of bioinformatics.
